# symfony-geometry-api
Calculate geometry objects based on Symfony

## TASK
- you will use the MVC framework that we use: Symfony
- you will deliver solution in form of a Github repository.
- create 2 models/classes - Circle and Triangle
- implement 2 methods:

I.) calculate surface
II.) calculate diameter

- create routes:

      [GET] /triangle/{a}/{b}/{c}

      [GET] /circle/{radius}

- routes must return JSON with serialized objects and calculated surfaces and diameters. For example:

```json
{
 "type": "circle",
 "radius": 2.0,
 "surface": 12.56,
 "circumference": 12.56,
}
```

or

```json
{
 "type": "triangle",
 "a": 3.0,
 "b": 4.0,
 "c": 5.0,
 "surface": 6.0,
 "circumference": 12.0,
}
```

- create service/or similar structure for the given framework (for example app.geometry_calculator)
- implement method for sum of areas for two given objects
- implement method for sum of diameters for two given objects
